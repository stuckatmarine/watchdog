# Install Notes
- Make sure to use python2.7 (not python 3!, Tensorflow is not compatable on pi for 3+)
- Run watchdog.py, install dependencies with pip as needed
- Run download_weights.sh to get weights (large files not normally stored on git)
- Update watchdogAutostart.sh with the location of your virtual env to activate
- Edit your "/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart.txt" with "@/pathtomyscript/watchdogAutostart.sh" to run on startup
