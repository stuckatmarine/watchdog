## Watchdog React Dashboard — An "[isomorphic](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/)" Web App

### Requirements

  * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6.5 or newer

## Quick Start

### Install

Install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.
```
$ yarn install
```

### 3. Run 

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/build` folder. As soon as the initial build completes, it will start the
Node.js server (`node build/server.js`) and [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
with [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement) on top of it.

```shell
$ yarn start
```

> [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — Node.js server (`build/server.js`)<br>
> [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) — GraphQL server and IDE<br>

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

For more info please refer to [getting started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide to download and run the project (Node.js >= 6.5)
