# Watchdog

## Problem
Frank has a dog. <br/>
Frank’s dog enjoys being outside for extended periods of time. <br/>
Frank’s dog likes to go outside immediately when the upstairs tenants' dogs are outside and come in when they are not.<br/>
Frank’s dog also likes to dig and perform other undesirable behaviours when it is bored or would like to come inside.<br/>
Frank is often busy and can not monitor his dog 24/7.<br/>
Don’t be like Frank. <br/>

Noah has a dog.<br/>
Noah also has a Watchdog.<br/>
Noah is notified if his dog digs or would like to be let inside/outside.<br/>
Noah can focus on his studies and not worry about his dog.<br/>
Be like Noah.<br/>
