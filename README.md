# Watchdog

## Problem
Frank has a dog. 
Frank’s dog enjoys being outside for extended periods of time. 
Frank’s dog likes to go outside immediately when the upstairs tenants' dogs are outside and come in when they are not.
Frank’s dog also likes to dig and perform other undesirable behaviours when it is bored or would like to come inside.
Frank is often busy and can not monitor his dog 24/7.
Don’t be like Frank. 

Noah has a dog.
Noah also has a Watchdog.
Noah is notified if his dog digs or would like to be let inside.
Noah can focus on his studies and not worry about his dog.
Be like Noah.
