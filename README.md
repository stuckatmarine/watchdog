# Watchdog

## Problem
Frank has a dog. <br/>
Frank’s dog enjoys being outside for extended periods of time. <br/>
Frank’s dog likes to go outside immediately when the upstairs tenants' dogs are outside and come in when they are not.<br/>
Frank’s dog also likes to dig and perform other undesirable behaviours when it is bored or would like to come inside.<br/>
Frank is often busy and can not monitor his dog 24/7.<br/>
Don’t be like Frank. <br/>

Noah has a dog.<br/>
Noah also has a Watchdog.<br/>
Noah is notified if his dog digs or would like to be let inside/outside.<br/>
Noah can focus on his studies and not worry about his dog.<br/>
Be like Noah.<br/>


## Solution
The Watchdog (pi) requests a config file from the flask server, if response fails it uses a local file.<br/>
It will then take pictures every 'intervalTime' seconds, and check the image for specific objects chosen by the user, using yolov2 or yolov2-tiny.<br/>
If a desired object is found the image and yolo log data are sent to the server, stored in a mongoDB (database) and send to the user (SMS/Email/Web-App).<br/>
The user configuration can be changed in real time on the web-app or locally on the Watchdog.<br/>
